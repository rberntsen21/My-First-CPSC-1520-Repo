# My First CPSC 1520 Repository	

This is a code repository for me to learn about version control using git.

I have learnt how to:

- Install Github Desktop
- Create a local repository
- Commit Changes to my repository
- Publish my code to Github.com
- Open my repository in visual studio code (My Editor)
